Rawadf is a program for manipulating extended ADF images
such as those created with the "rawread" program available
on Aminet (http://aminet.net/package/disk/backup/rawread).

It can be used to display information about an Extended ADF
file, compare two Extended ADF files, merge Extended ADF files
together, replace tracks from one Extended ADF file with
tracks from another, and split Extended ADF files.

Type 'rawadf help' for usage instructions.
